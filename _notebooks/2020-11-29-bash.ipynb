    "Most modern operating systems feature two forms of interfaces for user input: a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interaction (CLI).Â Although you can make any changes via the graphical user interface, you can make the same changes in CLI form, using a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is a program that serves as a keyboard-driven interface between the user and the operating system. It includes a command-line interpreter that accepts the user input via the keyboard, evaluates it, starts programs if necessary, and returns the output in the form of text output to the user. Each shell has its own programming language. This makes it possible to write shell scripts that automate complex tasks. Each shell runs in a terminal.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the old days, independent devices, or so-called \"hard copy terminals\" (printer or screen plus keyboard), were used. Modern computers no longer have those, replaced by terminal emulators - programs that provide users with a graphical window for interacting with the shell. As scientists, we rely on strong computer clusters to reveal answers to many questionsÂ and to perform many tasks automatically. There are many ways to interact with these computers, but the fastest and mostÂ reliable way is the terminal emulators which is the main focus of today's presentation.\n",

For\n     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names\n     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-\n     ciated information.\n\n     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-\n     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are\n     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-\n     rately and in lexicographical order.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.\n\n     -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per\n             line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.\n\n     -A      List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the super-\n             user.\n\n     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).\n\n     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by\n             ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \\xxx,\n             where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.\n\n     -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.\n\n     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to\n             a terminal.\n\n     -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting (-t) or\n             long printing (-l).\n\n     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).\n\n     -e      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if\n             present, in long (-l) output.\n\n     -F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a\n             directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at\n             sign (`@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after\n             each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a ver-\n             tical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.\n\n     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.\n\n     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining\n             CLICOLOR in the environment.  (See below.)\n\n     -g      This option is only available for compatibility with POSIX; it is\n             used to display the group name in the long (-l) format output\n             (the owner name is suppressed).\n\n     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is\n             assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are specified.\n\n     -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n             Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n             number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.\n\n     -i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode num-\n             ber).\n\n     -k      If the -s option is specified, print the file size allocation in\n             kilobytes, not blocks.

In addition, for each directory whose contents are displayed, the\n     total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is\n     displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the information for the\n     files in the directory.  If the file or directory has extended\n     attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by\n     a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended secu-\n     rity information (such as an access control list), the permissions field\n     printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.  If the -%\n     option is given, a '%' character follows the permissions field for data-\n     less files and directories, possibly replacing the '@' or '+' character.\n\n     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or\n     future, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of\n     the hour and minute fields.\n\n     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n\n     option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.\n\n     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and\n     minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.  If\n     the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file is pre-\n     ceded by ``->''.\n\n     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type,\n     owner permissions, and group permissions.  The entry type character\n     describes the type of file, as follows:\n\n           b     Block special file.\n           c     Character special file.\n           d     Directory.\n           l     Symbolic link.\n           s     Socket link.\n           p     FIFO.\n           -     Regular file.\n\n     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group\n     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character posi-\n     tions:\n\n           1.   If r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable.\n\n           2.   If w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable.\n\n           3.   The first of the following that applies:\n\n                      S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not exe-\n                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the\n                            group permissions, the file is not executable and\n                            set-group-ID mode is set.\n\n                      s     If in the owner permissions, the file is exe-\n                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the\n                            group permissions, the file is executable and set-\n                            group-ID mode is set.\n\n                      x     The file is executable or the directory is search-\n                            able.\n\n                      -     The file is neither readable, writable, exe-\n                            cutable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode,\n                            nor sticky.  (See below.)\n\n                These next two apply only to the third character in the last\n                group (other permissions).\n\n                      T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute\n                            or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or\n                            sticky(8).)\n\n                      t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is search-\n                            able or executable.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(8).)\n\nEXAMPLES\n     The following is how to do an ls listing sorted by increasing size\n\n           ls -lrS\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n     The ls utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The following environment variables affect the execution of ls:\n\n     BLOCKSIZE       If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block\n                     counts (see -s) will be displayed in units of that size\n                     block.\n\n     CLICOLOR        Use ANSI color sequences to distinguish file types.  See\n                     LSCOLORS below.  In addition to the file types mentioned\n                     in the -F option some extra attributes (setuid bit set,\n                     etc.) are also displayed.  The colorization is dependent\n                     on a terminal type with the proper termcap(5) capabili-\n                     ties.  The default ``cons25'' console has the proper\n                     capabilities, but to display the colors in an xterm(1),\n                     for example, the TERM variable must be set to\n                     ``xterm-color''.  Other terminal types may require simi-\n                     lar adjustments.  Colorization is silently disabled if\n                     the output isn't directed to a terminal unless the\n                     CLICOLOR_FORCE variable is defined.\n\n     CLICOLOR_FORCE  Color sequences are normally disabled if the output isn't\n                     directed to a terminal.  This can be overridden by set-\n                     ting this flag.  The TERM variable still needs to refer-\n                     ence a color capable terminal however otherwise it is not\n                     possible to determine which color sequences to use.\n\n     COLUMNS         If this variable contains a string representing a decimal\n                     integer, it is used as the column position width for dis-\n                     playing multiple-text-column output.  The ls utility cal-\n                     culates how many pathname text columns to display based\n                     on the width provided.  (See -C and -x.)\n\n     LANG            The locale to use when determining the order of day and\n                     month in the long -l format output.  See environ(7) for\n                     more information.\n\n     LSCOLORS        The value of this variable describes what color to use\n                     for which attribute when colors are enabled with\n                     CLICOLOR.  This string is a concatenation of pairs of the\n                     format fb, where f is the foreground color and b is the\n                     background color.\n\n                     The color designators are as follows:\n\n                           a     black\n                           b     red\n                           c     green\n                           d     brown\n                           e     blue\n                           f     magenta\n                           g     cyan\n                           h     light grey\n                           A     bold black, usually shows up as dark grey\n                           B     bold red\n                           C     bold green\n                           D     bold brown, usually shows up as yellow\n                           E     bold blue\n                           F     bold magenta\n                           G     bold cyan\n                           H     bold light grey; looks like bright white\n                           x     default foreground or background\n\n                     Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.  The actual\n                     display may differ depending on the color capabilities of\n                     the terminal in use.\n\n                     The order of the attributes are as follows:\n\n                           1.   directory\n                           2.   symbolic link\n                           3.   socket\n                           4.   pipe\n                           5.   executable\n                           6.   block special\n                           7.   character special\n                           8.   executable with setuid bit set\n                           9.   executable with setgid bit set\n                           10.  directory writable to others, with sticky bit\n                           11.  directory writable to others, without sticky\n                                bit\n\n                     The default is \"exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad\", i.e. blue fore-\n                     ground and default background for regular directories,\n                     black foreground and red background for setuid executa-\n                     bles, etc.\n\n     LS_COLWIDTHS    If this variable is set, it is considered to be a colon-\n                     delimited list of minimum column widths.  Unreasonable\n                     and insufficient widths are ignored (thus zero signifies\n                     a dynamically sized column).  Not all columns have\n                     changeable widths.  The fields are, in order: inode,\n                     block count, number of links, user name, group name,\n                     flags, file size, file name.\n\n     TERM            The CLICOLOR functionality depends on a terminal type\n                     with color capabilities.\n\n     TZ              The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See\n                     environ(7) for more information.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n     The group field is now automatically included in the long listing for\n     files in order to be compatible with the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')\n     specification.\n\nLEGACY DESCRIPTION\n     In legacy mode, the -f option does not turn on the -a option and the -g,\n     -n, and -o options do not turn on the -l option.\n\n     Also, the -o option causes the file flags to be included in a long (-l)\n     output; there is no -O option.\n\n     When -H is specified (and not overridden by -L or -P) and a file argument\n     is a symlink that resolves to a non-directory file, the output will\n     reflect the nature of the link, rather than that of the file.  In legacy\n     operation, the output will describe the file.\n\n     For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).\n\nSEE ALSO\n     chflags(1), chmod(1), sort(1), xterm(1), compat(5), termcap(5),\n     symlink(7), sticky(8)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The ls utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').\n\nHISTORY\n     An ls command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.\n\nBUGS\n     To maintain backward compatibility, the relationships between the many\n     options are quite complex.\n\nBSD                              May 19, 2002                              BSD\n"
